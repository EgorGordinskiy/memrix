# Memrix - Foreign Language Vocabulary Learning App

Welcome to the **Memrix** project repository - an innovative application for learning foreign language vocabulary using flashcard sets. This project is being developed as a personal pet project and is currently in an active development stage.

## About the Project

**Memrix** is an application designed to assist users in learning foreign language vocabulary through the use of flashcard sets. Users can create their own sets of flashcards for learning or use existing sets prepared by other users.

The application is being developed using the following technologies:

- **React**: The primary frontend framework for building the application's interface.
- **TypeScript**: A programming language for adding static typing to JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A fast tool for frontend development.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A library for managing the application state.
- **JSON Server**: A temporary solution for simulating a server and managing data. (Note: JSON Server is used temporarily; in the future, there are plans to develop a custom server using NestJS.)

## Features

**Memrix** provides the following features:

- Creation and editing of flashcard sets with foreign words and their translations.
- Selection of a learning mode that allows users to view flashcards and their translations for memorization.
- Various testing modes to assess knowledge of foreign words.
- Using pre-existing flashcard sets created by other users.
